# Dungeon World Character Manager

## TODO / Wishlist

+ Roll history should be connected to a character, and only show history for the current character.
+ Circles with a number in the middle representing the stats available (1 for each). Drag and drop these in to the corresponding stat column (STR, DEX, etc) When one is dragged from one stat to another, and that stat already held a number, that number drops back to the 'staging area' for the stat circles. (This feature would better visualize the UX around choosing stats, and eliminate the need for a post-submission validation on stats.)
+ Save to a database. It's all local storage in the browser at the moment.
