# Dungeon World Character Manager

This is my React playground. As such, it 1) lacks tests, 2) needs refactored, 3) is buggy, 4) is about as usable as a blister pack of arsnic pills.

## Run it

On OSX:

```
git clone [this thing]
cd dungeon-world-app
open index.html
```

On other systems: I mean you get the idea, right?

## TODO / Wishlist

+ Save to a database. It's all local storage in the browser at the moment.
